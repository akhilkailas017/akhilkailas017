## About Me

I’m a full-stack web developer focused on building clean, reliable web applications across the frontend and backend.

I work primarily with modern JavaScript frameworks, Node.js APIs, and databases, and use blockchain technologies selectively where they add real value. I care about readable code, simple design decisions, and growing steadily as an engineer.
